# DomainAdaptation-for-indic-scripts
Purpose is using TransferLearning Creating a single model that will yield satisfactory results for several indic scripts which have a lot common in their feature set. 
Bengali, Hindi, Gurmukhi etc Indic Scripts as generated from the same origin tend to have a lot common in their feature space, So by using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Introducing GANs and Gradient Reversal Layer a single model can be prepared to reduce  complexity during analysis and processing of the corresponding languages.
